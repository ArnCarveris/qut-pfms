Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has been developing Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology in various forms since 1991. In the past, subsequent to receiving commands from an autonomous traffic controller, flight trajectory prediction has been performed by linear methods which ignore the states of the aircraft, weather effects and successive waypoints. A Predictive Flight Management System (PFMS) allows for a UAV to have some level of intelligence to determine whether it will be capable of intercepting a demanded waypoint at a given time, whether to ignore waypoints that may/may not be invalid if there is a higher then expected latency in the system, and how to handle the difference between mandatory (mission) waypoints and the demanded waypoints from the traffic controller. In advanced stages of the project the PFMS may include concepts such as autonomous collision avoidance that is independent of the autonomous traffic controller.

This year the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (ARCAA) requires a PFMS for the Smart Skies QUT Uninhabited Aerial System (QUAS) resulting in the PFMS project. The code contained herein is the progessive development of this system by a 4th year avionics engineering undergraduate.
